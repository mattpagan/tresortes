This is a small GUI program that illustrates bibliomancy. The ritual of opening a book to a random passage 
and taking meaning from the result was used historically to answer questions and to tell the future. This
program has three buttons--one for the Bible, one for the Aeneid, and one for the combined Iliad and Odyssey. 
Each of theese texts was popularly consulted for bibliomancy in Medieval Europe, Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, 
respectively. For more information, http://en.wikipedia.org/bibliomancy.
